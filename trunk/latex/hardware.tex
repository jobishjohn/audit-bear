\subsection{Hardware Issues}
Next we describe ways to identify machines that have hardware problems, such as screen calibration issues, machines with a low battery, terminals that closed early, and machines that recorded unknown, but possibly severe events.  

\subsubsection{Calibration Errors}
The first of these analyses detects machines with recurring calibration errors and machines that had recorded votes while possibly not calibrated.  By finding events that correspond to a screen that is not calibrated and to the recalibration of that screen, we can find if votes were cast in between those times.

\subsubsection{Low Battery Errors}
The second analysis regarding hardware issues looks for machines with an unusually large number of events titled \textquotedblleft Terminal shutdown - IPS Exit.\textquotedblright  We infer that these machines have a low battery because they experience a more-than-normal number of events related to the Internal Power Supply.  

\subsubsection{Terminals Closed Early}
Additionally, our tool searches for machines that recorded a warning event about the terminal closing early.  In order for this event to occur, a trained technician must enter a password to access the service menu and make a particular selection to close the machine.  If a machine is closed in this manner during election day, there may be something wrong with it that is preventing votes from being cast correctly.  

\subsubsection{Unknown Warning Anomalies}
Lastly, there is a set of events that have questionable meanings, but could potentially represent hardware issues.  [ELABORATE]

\subsubsection{needs to be split up for above subsubsections}
Analyses such as these can help officials identify machines that may require maintenance or need to be replaced.  In the case of a machine having ballots cast when it is not calibrated, it may not have correctly captured the voter's intent.  Depending on the magnitude of the situation, this could cause a different outcome in the election.  If our analyses detect other hardware problems with a machine, it may not be recording votes accurately; these votes may not even appear in the event log or ballot images.  If the event log and the ballot images do not record ballots being cast, then it is nearly impossible for officials to realize votes are not being counted.  

Due to the available resources and the nature of these analyses, we made assumptions regarding the meaning of events and the severity of the situation.  Currently, the iVotronic manuals do not describe the meaning of the events that appear in the event log; because of this, we are not able to guarantee that the event \textquotedblleft Terminal shutdown - IPS Exit\textquotedblright means the machine has a low battery.  This assumption is also applicable to our calibration analysis and our detection of unknown warning events.  If a description of each event was available, we could be more definitive in our results and possibly implement analyses that report other useful hardware failures.
