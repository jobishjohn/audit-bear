\subsection{Hardware Issues}
Next we describe ways to identify machines that have hardware problems, such as screen calibration issues, machines with a low battery, terminals that closed early, and machines that recorded unknown, but possibly severe events.  Analyses such as these can help officials identify machines that may require maintenance or need to be replaced.  

\subsubsection{Calibration Errors}
The first of these analyses detects machines with recurring calibration errors and machines that had recorded votes while possibly not calibrated.  By finding events that correspond to a screen that is not calibrated and to the recalibration of that screen, we can find if votes were cast in between those times.

In the case of a machine having ballots cast when it is not calibrated, it may not have correctly captured the voter's intent.  Depending on the magnitude of the situation, this could cause a different outcome in the election.  If our analyses detect other hardware problems with a machine, it may not be recording votes accurately; these votes may not even appear in the event log or ballot images.  If the event log and the ballot images do not record ballots being cast, then it is nearly impossible for officials to realize votes are not being counted.  

\subsubsection{Power Supply Errors}
The second analysis regarding hardware issues looks for machines with an unusually large number of events titled \textquotedblleft Terminal shutdown - IPS Exit.\textquotedblright  We infer that these machines have a low battery because they experience a more-than-normal number of events related to the Internal Power Supply.  

Currently, the publicly available iVotronic manuals do not describe the meaning of all the events that appear in the event log.  Because of this, we had to make some educated guesses about the meaning of each event.  [A couple sentences explaining why we assume IPS Exit is related to low battery] \textquotedblleft Terminal shutdown - IPS Exit\textquotedblright means the machine has a low battery.

\subsubsection{Terminals Closed Early}
Additionally, our tool searches for machines that recorded a warning event about the terminal closing early.  In order for this event to occur, a trained technician must enter a password to access the service menu and make a particular selection to close the machine.  If a machine is closed in this manner during election day, there may be something wrong with it that is preventing votes from being cast correctly.  

\subsubsection{Unknown Warning Anomalies}
Lastly, there is a set of events that have questionable meanings, but could potentially represent hardware issues.
