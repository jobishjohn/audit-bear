\subsection*{Abstract}
Voting audit logs produced by Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) machines are often unwieldy and unintelligible to a human reader. These logs detail all events recorded on the DREs and include data on ballots cast and post-election procedures. The authors of the paper \textquotedblleft Auditing a DRE-Based Election in South Carolina\textquotedblright~\cite{Buell2011} demonstrated that these logs can be analyzed to uncover both procedural errors and  election anomalies.  In this study, we replicate the results from the aforementioned paper and develope additional analyses. These include identification of procedural errors by election officials, DRE hardware problems and precinct statistics. We have integrated these reports into a public website that produces a detailed report from the ES\&S iVotronic log files.  We intend this work to stand as proof-of-concept software for future auditing tools and as an immediately accessible tool to assist those working with election auditing and integrity.
