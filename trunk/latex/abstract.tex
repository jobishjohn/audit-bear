\subsection*{Abstract}
Voting audit logs, produced by electronic voting systems, contain information that is useful for uncovering procedural errors and election anomalies, but are currently unwieldy and hard for election officials to use in post-election audits.  We have devised a way to make the auditing process quick and efficient for election officials.  In order to audit elections, we develop new techniques for detecting equipment problems and procedural mistakes made by election workers; we have automated these analyses for a user-friendly process.  We implemented our methods and built a website for this tool that has the capability of analyzing electronic voting machine log files.  We intend this work to assist those working with election auditing to quickly identify voting equipment or procedural issues and correct them before election results are certified.  Such issues include locating voting machines or media containing vote data that have not been included in the aggregated count, and voting equipment that needs maintenance before the next election.
