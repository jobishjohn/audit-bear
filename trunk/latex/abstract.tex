\subsection*{Abstract}
Voting audit logs produced by electronic voting systems contain information that is useful for uncovering procedural errors and election anomalies, but are currently unwieldy and hard for election officials to use in post-election audits. In this work, we developed new methods to analyze these audit logs. Our work demonstrates new uses of audit log data and extends the range of election problems that can be detected this way. We created a web application, freely available to the public, that applies our methods to detect procedural errors and system deficiencies.  Election officials can use our tool to identify memory cartridges containing precinct totals that were not uploaded on election night, machines that may have experienced hardware problems during the election, and polling locations that closed late or had voters waiting in line for extended periods. We tested our analyses on data from the South Carolina 2010 elections and were able to uncover solely through the analysis of audit logs that there were 1127 votes not counted in the certified totals in Richland County, South Carolina.
