\subsection{Hardware Issues}
Election officials may be interested in identifying machines that have hardware problems, such as screen calibration issues, machines with a low battery, terminals that closed early, and machines that recorded unknown, but possibly severe events.  The first of these analyses detects machines with recurring calibration errors and machines that had recorded votes while possibly not calibrated.  By finding the events that correspond to a screen that is not calibrated and to the recalibration of that screen, we can find if votes were cast in between those times.  The second analysis regarding hardware issues looks for machines with an unusually large number of events titled \textquotedblleft Terminal shutdown - IPS Exit\textquotedblright .  We infer that these machines have a low battery because they experience a more-than-normal number of events related to the Internal Power Supply.  Additionally, our tool searches for machines that recorded a warning event about the terminal closing early.  In order for this event to occur, a trained technician must enter a password to access the service menu and make a particular selection to close the machine.  If a machine is closed in this manner during election day, there must be something wrong with it that is preventing votes from being cast correctly.  Lastly, there is a set of events that have questionable meanings, but could potentially represent hardware issues.  

Analyses such as these can help officials identify machines that may require maintenance or to be replaced.  In the case of a machine having ballots cast on it when it is not calibrated, it may not have captured the voter's intent.  Depending on the magnitude of the situation, this could cause a different outcome in the election.  If our analyses detect other hardware problems with a machine, it may not be recording votes accurately; these votes may not even appear in the event log or ballot images.  If the event log and the ballot images do not record ballots being cast, then it is nearly impossible for officials to realize votes are not being counted.  

Due to the available resources and the nature of these analyses, assumptions were made regarding the meaning of events and the severity of the situation.  Currently, there is no user manual or detailed description of the events that appear in the event log; because of this, we are not able to guarantee that the event \textquotedblleft Terminal shutdown - IPS Exit\textquotedblright means the machine has a low battery.  This assumption is also applicable to our calibration analysis and our detection of unknown warning events.  If a description of each event was available, we could be more definitive in our results and possibly implement analyses that report other useful hardware failures.

\subsection{Procedural Errors}
Our tool can detect procedural errors and poll worker mistakes; a few of these are: precincts that do not print zero tapes on the morning of election day, using a master PEB to activate ballots, opening and closing machines with different PEB.  According to the South Carolina poll worker training video (citation), poll workers are required to print at least one zero tape per polling location on the morning of the election.  Using the event log, our tool checks each polling location for this event and reports the locations that did not record this event.  Another way our tool finds procedural errors is by crosschecking the master PEBs with the PEBs used to activate ballots.  Poll workers should be using non-master PEBs to activate ballots so that the PEBs do not get switched.  Along the same lines, we report incidents of opening and closing a machine with different PEBs.  A machine should be opened and closed with the same master PEB; if not, it may be more likely that this PEB does not get uploaded.   When poll workers cancel ballots, they must select a reason why; this is another way to detect errors.  There are seven options for canceling a ballot: wrong ballot, voter left after the ballot was issued, voter left before the ballot was issued, voter request, printer problem, terminal problem, or an unspecified reason.  If there are any instances of canceling a ballot due to a printer problem, it could be an indicator of a procedural error because ballots are not printed.  In other cases, if there is a large number of a specific reason, such as having the wrong ballot, this could indicate the poll workers are repeatedly issuing the wrong ballot.  

It may be beneficial to election officials if they could detect which locations poll workers are following the required procedures in order to mitigate larger problems.  If election officials are aware of the procedures that are not being followed, they will hopefully be able to mitigate them.  This will allow for more efficient audits as well as a better voting experience for voters.  Procedural errors can cause many problems including lost votes, incorrect vote counts, disgruntled voters, and long lines.

While our analyses detect an important set of errors, there are certainly many more procedures that can be analyzed.  In addition to printing zero tapes in the morning, poll workers are required to print results tapes at the end of the election; unfortunately, this is not detectable due to the way the event log is produced.  We have inferred from the event logs that the poll workers are extracting the compact flashes before printing the results tapes, therefore the event log shows no record of the event.

\subsection{Systematic Date and Time Errors}\label{an:date}
The iVotronic DREs append each audit event in chronological order.  Each event is marked with a time-stamp based on the DRE's internal clock.  We discovered and report on a variety of errors by classifying the type of errors experienced. Correct time-stamps are critical in post election audits and often incorrect stamps can not be automatically corrected post election.  Previous works identify and remark on some of these date errors~\cite{Buell2011,Sandler2007}.  We further attempt to classify and automate the identification of these issues.

Erroneous time-stamps can invalidate the audit-logs and often preclude data from being used in automated reports.  Determining machines to have either valid or invalid time-stamps has a lot of gray area and different errors will affect different analyses.  Some machines experienced time-stamps that would blank to \textquoteleft 00/00/00 00:00:00' for only a couple of events.  This naturally wouldn't affect data looking at opening and closing times, but would create outliers or gaps in data measuring time between votes cast.  

We found it simplest to classify date errors into two categories.  Those errors resulting from machines not having their clocks set appropriately and those resulting from apparent bugs in the iVotronic time-stamp mechanism itself.  Our website includes an automated a report that attempts to identify and group as many of these errors as possible.

First, machines shipped or set with incorrect dates were identified.  These errors all suggest the need for a more thorough pre-election check of each machine's clock.   Any machines experiencing manual clock adjustments on election day were included in the report as well as those machines which opened for voting on a date that was wildly incorrect (i.e. dates well before pre-election or dates after election day). This mostly included machines that did not account for Daylight Saving Time or  those machines that didn't set their initial date until after opening for voting.  All the above machines were checked as closing on a valid election day.  Pre-voting dates were not considered as they appeared to be inconsistent among the different counties. Machines which open and close on an improbable dates are separately identified as machines that had bad dates that went uncorrected..  

Machines experiencing additional date errors were classified in a separate report.  Many machines were found to have anomalous date changes that weren't paired with the normal date set event. [Figure 1 will show the 4/12 jump in Berkeley county] Often before the clock on a machine is first set the dates will show up as being many years into the future or as a zero date.  This isn't a problem as most  of these machines are set correctly before being opened for voting.  However, there are many places in the logs were the date will seemingly randomly jump to a date far into the future or the past and remain there until manually corrected.  [Figure 2 12\/21 in Berk County] shows a case where the date jumps ahead to 12/21/2010 for two events before changing back.  These machines were automatically identified by looking for any major date jumps that occur on election day or zero stamps being recorded after machines are open. Machines experiencing many date jumps may require troubleshooting from ES\&S.  It may be a more systematic issue that the date on an iVotronic can apparently change for no reason.

We strongly advise that procedures for setting the clocks on machines are reviewed.  The unknown date jumps seen in the logs are concerning, but generally are not creating as many audit issues compared to machines whose date were never set correctly.

Accurate clocks directly impact the usefulness and correctness of the audit logs. Ensuring that every single machine is set correctly is not necessarily a simple task.  We would recommend that each machine is configured accurately before being sent to the precincts.  Additionally, all machines should be double checked for a correct time before opening for voting.  Daylight Saving Time settings are also potential concern.  Many machines (statistic for anderson) were found to be adjusted forward by an hour during election day.  

The Authors of \textquotedblleft Casting Votes in the Auditorium\textquotedblright~\cite{Sandler2007} propose a distributed network between DREs.  This \textquoteleft Auditorium\textquoteright provides a far more robust system to ensure accurate and verifiable audit logs.  They propose a system where all the election machines are networked together and append to a common audit log verified by each machine.  This allows for more error redundancy and removes the logistical issue involved in making sure every single machine has their date correctly set.
