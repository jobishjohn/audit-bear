\section{Background}

\subsection{Introduction to the iVotronic}
Approximately 422 jurisdictions in the United States used the ES\&S iVotronic electronic voting terminal in 2010.  A brief description of  its functionality and main system components follows:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Voting terminal. The voting terminal is a stand-alone touchscreen voting  unit. The ports available in the back of the terminal include: serial port, compact flash card slot and power supply port. The terminal is equipped with an internal battery which keeps the terminal operational during power failure periods. To comply with federal standards, at least one audio (ADA) terminal is placed in each precinct to assist the visually impaired voters.

\item Personalized Electronic Ballot (PEB). The PEB is a proprietary cartridge designed by ES\&S to operate the iVotronic terminal.  The PEB is placed in a slot located to the left of iVotronic's touchscreen. The terminal and the PEB communicate through the infrared port. The South Carolina counties deploy two types of PEBs to the precinct: a) the green band master PEB and b) the red band activator PEB. Both types of PEB have the same functionality, however, poll workers are trained to perform the following tasks with each PEB type.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Master PEB.  Poll workers use the master PEB to open polls on election day. When the PEB is placed in the terminal, the touchscreen displays the precinct's name programmed in the PEB so that poll workers can verify the polling location information and date/time registered in the terminal's internal clock. If the information displayed is correct, the poll workers open the terminal for voting. The same master PEB should be used to open all terminals of the polling location. In the same fashion, the master PEB should be used to close all terminals of the polling location at the end of the voting day. When the terminal closes, it uploads  its totals onto the master PEB. The master PEB accumulates the precinct totals which are accumulated into the official tally.
    \item Activator PEB.  This PEB is used by  poll workers to activate ballots for voters. The number of activator PEBs that the election officials program for each precinct is proportional to the number of terminals and poll workers assigned to the precinct. The ratio varies depending on the jurisdiction criteria.
    \end{itemize}
\item Removable Compact Flash card (CF). The CF cards are programmed at election central and installed in the back of the voting terminal prior to precinct deployment. The CF cards contains graphic (bitmap) files read by the voting terminal during the voting process. The CF cards are also used as an external memory device: the audit log and ballot images are written to the CF card when the terminal is closed for voting. Once the polls close, the CF cards are removed from the back of the terminal and delivered to election headquarters on election night. 

\item External printer module. This module is connected to the serial port on the back of the voting terminal. The thermal printer produces the precinct zero tape and results tape. Poll workers are instructed to print the zero tape once all iVotronics of the precinct are opened for voting. In the same fashion, the results tape should be produced when all voting terminals are closed for voting on election night.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description of logs}
We used three iVotronic system logs to perform the analyses described in the next section. The event log (EL152.lst), ballot image file (EL155.lst) and the ES\&S election reporting manager system log (EL168a.lst).  The header of the log files identify the County's name, the type and date of the election, the date the report was generated and the election ID. The election ID is a parameter generated by the ES\&S election programming software to uniquely identify the specific election.

The event log (152.lst) lists all iVotronic terminals used on the election. The log records the terminal configuration at headquarters prior to precinct deployment which begins with the “clear and test” of the terminal to delete previous election data from the terminal's memory. The log also records, in a chronological order, all relevant election day events including polls open and polls closing and the number of ballots cast.  The event log contains several columns which include: iVotronic's terminal serial number, PEB serial number, PEB type, date, time, event code and event description. An excerpt of  an event log is given in the appendix.

The ballot image file (155.lst) contains all ballot images saved by the iVotronic terminals during the voting process. The ballot images are segregated by precinct and terminal where the votes were cast. The ballots are saved in a random order to protect the privacy of the voter. An asterisk (*) indicates the beginning of each ballot. An excerpt of a ballot image file is given in the appendix.

The system log listing file (EL168a.lst) tracks activity in the election reporting database since its creation at the election headquarters. Its chronological entries reflect the commands executed by the operator(s) during  pre-election testing, election night reporting and post-election canvassing. This log contains the totals accumulated in the various precincts during election night reporting, as well as any warnings or errors reported by the reporting software system during the tabulation process. The system log also tracks the uploading of the PEBs and CF cards to the central election reporting database. Manual adjustment of precinct totals are also documented in the system log file. An excerpt of a system log file is given in appendix section.

\section{Related Work}
Having an accurate method of auditing elections has motivated numerous studies to analyze election results.  Many election technology systems provide a practical way of auditing elections; for example, optical scanning systems provide a usable paper trail that allows for more accurate auditing.  On the other hand, not all DRE machines provide this type of paper trail.  Our work pertains to the elections in South Carolina, which do not require the creation of a paper trail, but do provide the audit logs from the machines.  We have created a set of post-election analyses that use these audit logs.  While our research focuses on the data produced by the ES\&S iVotronic, the results can be made applicable to other systems; other work has been conducted on event logs tailored to other machines.  There have also been a number of publications regarding a variety of post-election analyses. 

Election technologies’ outputs vary in a number of ways.  One way, which impacts the type of analyses that can be conducted, is the content of the event logs.  Research into the event logs of the AccuVote Optical Scanning system shows 23 possible events; this allowed the authors to implement an analysis in the form of a finite state machine.  Having fewer events and a set of allowable event sequences results in an analysis that determines if a machine has acted “normally” [2].  This differs from our work because the iVotronic events are much more flexible.  This method of analysis is superior to our analysis when conducted on the AccuVote Optical Scan, but is not adaptable to other systems, whereas our analyses can be manipulated to evaluate various systems.

Many different analyses have been simulated and implemented that provide important results about elections.  There have been a number of studies regarding analyses using the iVotronic audit logs [3][5].  Our work is complimentary to [3]; we replicate their results in addition to providing new and essential analyses.  The prior research into the voting machine logs in South Carolina has revealed uncounted votes and problems with the audit data.  This previous work has been able to offer possible reasons and explanations as to why the problems occurred, but our research simply reports what was wrong [3].  We did not refer to printed results tapes or other additional material aside from the audit logs.  Other work has shown analyses using the protected count of votes on each machine and comparing this to the printed results tapes.  This report also finds dates that were most likely inaccurate; with further investigation, they concluded that the hardware clock was incorrect [5].

Our research provides analyses to identify similar problems, but in a way that could be automated.  There has also been research published on simulated analyses.  A common problem in the voting system is the occurrence of long lines.  Many studies have researched ways to mitigate long lines at polling locations; one such study has simulated the flow of voters through the voting process at polling location.  They use this simulation to determine the optimal number of voters per voting machine, and correspondingly, the correct number of voting machines per polling location based on the number of registered voters at that particular location [4].  This work makes more assumptions than are desired, thus making the results less helpful.  The authors assume a certain time it takes to vote and certain peak hours.  Our analysis infers this information from the event log to provide a more realistic view of whether the polling location experienced long lines or not.

Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs) are a different type of audit logs.  These logs allow the user disregard the voting machine technology and verify that their vote was cast as intended.  VVPATs differ greatly from audit logs produced by DRE machines, such as the iVotronic.  Unlike the audit logs we used in our analyses, VVPATs are viewed and verified by the voter- this is debatable, as voters do not always verify their vote [1].  In these logs, the voting machine is not assumed to be correct, whereas our analyses do make this assumption.  In the case that all voters verified their vote, then VVPATs would be a better auditing technique in some respects.  Additionally, VVPATs are more suited to audits concerning a DRE incorrectly capturing a voter’s intent.  Our work is more concerned with identifying cases of cast votes not being included in the final count, or issues at the polling place that might prevent the voter from casting their vote in the first place.
