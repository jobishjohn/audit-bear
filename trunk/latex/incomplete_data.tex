\subsection{Incomplete Audit Data}
Due to the manner in which both the event log and the ballot images file are created, they may not include all audit data.  When a machine occurs in the event log with recorded votes cast on it during election day, but does not appear in the ballot images file, this indicates that some ballots are missing from the ballot images file.  The reverse situation reveals the opposite error- the event log is not complete.  We developed a technique that identifies incomplete files.  

This analysis requires an event log and a ballot images file, where both files record machine serial numbers for any events and ballots cast.  Our analysis crosschecks these files for inconsistencies that may reveal unforeseen problems.  In our algorithm, we create two data structures; the first contains every machine used for voting and how many votes were cast on it according to the event log, the second contains every machine with ballots cast on it and how many ballots were cast on it according to the ballot images file.  Then, we compare these two structures.  Ideally, they would have the same contents and we could conclude that the files are consistent.  However, there may be cases where one file has a machine with more votes on it than the other file’s corresponding machine.  In this case, we would report file inconsistencies and provide the user with the machine serial number and the conflicting vote counts.
